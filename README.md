# U.S. College Dashboard

See the excellent U.S. government [college scorecard site](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/) for the official experience.
Data here is from the same [publicly licensed source](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/college-scorecard).

(I don't often say 'excellent' and 'U.S. government' very often, but the [cfpb's github](https://github.com/cfpb/consumerfinance.gov) is also very solid)

## Description

Move around the map to find the nearest colleges to the center of the map!

Defaults to 10, but open the sidebar on the left to increase or decrease this number.

Inspiration for spoke design from examples such as [https://rkda.xyz/spoke/](https://rkda.xyz/spoke/) (by [@rukku](https://twitter.com/rukku)) built with [Turf JS](https://turfjs.org/).

Data points come from U.S. College Scorecard Open Dataset (see the [official site](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/) for better filtering and searching!)
